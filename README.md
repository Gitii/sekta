### Sekta - Admx/Adml Viewer ü•≥

`Sekta` is a simple application that let's you open Windows/Office Group Policy Settings files (*.admx). Policies can be configured and exported as Powershell scripts or Intune OMA policies.

# Features
- View `admx` files
- Select any number of translations (`adml` files) and switch between them easily
- Configure policies (enable, disable, "not configured", including value & list support)
- Save and load configured policies
- Export policies as `powershell` script (ready to be executed) or view as OMA policies (for intune)
- Light & Dark mode üòé

# üßê Project idea

I haven't been able to find any public application that can view admx files. 
There are sites that let you view most known policies but it's impossible to play around with the policies. 
For example select a few policies and configure them. That's why I decided to write this desktop application.
Support for `adml` was neccessary because some OEMs do not name there policies meaningfully (but use uuids).
